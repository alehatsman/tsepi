# Data types

## Primitive data types

* Boolean - (true / false)
* Null - null
* Undefined - unassigned var
* Number
  * -(2^53 - 1) to (2^53 -1) 
  * +- Infinity
  * Nan
* BigInt - arbitrary precision int
* String - arr of els of 16-bit unassigned ints
* Symbol - uniq and immutable

## Object

Object - collection of properties
  - Property - key : value
    - Key - String or Symbol
    - Value - Any type

### Properties

Property types:

* Data property
* Accessor property

***Data property***
Associates a key with a value

Attributes:

* [[Value]] 
  * Type: Any
  * Desc: Value returned by get access
  * Default: undefined

* [[Writable]]
  * Type: Boolean
  * Desc: If false, [[Value]] can't be changed
  * Default: false

* [[Enumerable]]
  * Type: Boolean
  * Desc: If true, will be enumerated in for in
  * Default: false

* [[Configurable]]
  * Type: Boolean
  * Desc:
    If false:
      * can't be deleted
      * can't be changed to accessor prop
      * attrs other than [[Value]] and [[Writable]] can't be changed
  * Default: false

***Accessor property***

Attributes:

* [[Get]]
  * Type: Function or undefined
  * Desc: fn is called with an empty arg list and retrives the prop value whenever a get access to the value is performed.
  * Default: undefined

* [[Set]]
  * Type: Function or undefined
  * Desc: fn is called with an arg list that contains the assigned value and is executed whenever a specified property is attempted to be changed.
  * Default: undefined

* [[Enumerable]]
  * Type: Boolean
  * Desc: if true will be enumerated in for in
  * Default: false

* [[Configurable]]
  * Type: Boolean
  * Desc: 
    if false
      * can't be deleted
      * can't be changed to a data propery

### Functions

Functions are regular objects with the additional capability of being callable.

### Arrays

Arrays are regular objects

* integer-key-ed properties
* length property
* inherit from Array.prototype

### Keyed collections

* Map
* Set
* WeakMap
* WeakSet

* take object references as keys
* properties are not enumerated in Weak implementations
